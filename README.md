# Snap2HTML-NG

This application is a modified version of [Snap2HTML](https://github.com/rlv-dan/Snap2HTML) by RL Vision.

Snap2HTML takes a "snapshot" of the folder structure on your harddrive and saves it as an HTML file. What's unique about Snap2HTML is that the HTML file uses modern techniques to make it feel like a "real" application, displaying a treeview with folders that you can navigate to  view the files contained within. 

There is also a built in file search and ability to export data as plain text, csv or json. Still, everything is contained in a single HTML file that you can easily store or distribute.
